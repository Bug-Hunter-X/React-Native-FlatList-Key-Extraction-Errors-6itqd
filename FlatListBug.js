In React Native, when working with FlatList, using the `keyExtractor` prop incorrectly can lead to unexpected behavior.  For instance, if you use the index as the key, `keyExtractor={(item, index) => index}`, and your data changes (items are added or removed), the FlatList may not update correctly, leading to stale or duplicated items. This is because the `keyExtractor` should produce unique keys for each item in the data array, even if the data changes, to allow React Native to efficiently update the list.  Using the index directly violates this principle as indices shift when data changes. 

Another less common, but still problematic error related to FlatList, is failing to provide a `keyExtractor` altogether.  Without it, React Native will use a default mechanism to generate keys, often resulting in performance issues and incorrect rendering. This is due to React Native not having enough information to correctly identify and update items in the list efficiently.
